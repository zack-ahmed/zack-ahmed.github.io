		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>I have a variety of hobbies the main one being coding. Since I have started coding more frequently, I have seen that the sense of enjoyment I experience from it has increased. This enjoyment entices me to code more, that is the reason why it is my main hobbie. However coding is not my only hobbie, I also enjoy reading and playing basketball.  </p>

	  <h2>My projects</h2>
	  <p>Most of my projects have usually been in the form of code academy guided tasks. However I had always hoped to programme more complex and intuitive programmes as my knowledge of coding became more profound. However, my time at oracle has given me the abilities and the confidence to create my first application the polygon drawer. </p>

	  <h2>Aspirations</h2>
	  <p>I had a fascination with computers as a child, however I have only recently tried to fully understand how they actually work and how I can use them to there full potential. Coding, I believe is a gateway into a world of possibility and that realisation has inspired me to further better my understanding of computers. I would love one day to be able to express my ideas and my creativity though a computer.    </p>
